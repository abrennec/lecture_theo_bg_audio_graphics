This example shows you how vertex displacement can be implemented in the vertex shader. Checkout the code and get an understanding of what is happening. 
- Try to load other 3D geometry, i.e., maybe some complex geometry from a specific platform for free 3d objects.
  - What results do you receive? 
  - Do you encounter any problems?
