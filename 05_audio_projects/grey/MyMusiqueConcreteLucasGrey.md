# ThoughtsInProgress

## Conception
This track ,that I made for the course of theoretical background, processes in a subjective way how thought originate in an unordered way, then there is forced applied to organize these thoughts but they wont come to a conclusion and they resist.<br>
Over time with the process of understanding they are put in place and form a functioning system where they act together in groups and form new ways of output by connecting and make up a new energy to then paint a picture or sound arrangement of order that can be perceived in a positiv and constructive way.

## Technical implementation
The project was realized in ableton with the help of sampling and the use of some synthesizers in the form of an VST-plugin.<br>
The sampmled sounds that are used for this track are solely recorded in my room. Mainly I recorded when I hit onto something like my armchair, a glass bottle or when I pulled out some drawers of my shelf. These recorded samples where loaded into a drum rack and have been processed through various chains of audio effects like compressor, flanger, overdrive and reverb. They form the basis of the audiotrack because how they are arranged in the beginning of the track, they represent the unordered thoughts that rage around in a random way. <br>
The Synthesizers form are whats been used to bring order into the chaos and represent the energy that is applied to these unordered thoughts and then form new ways of arrangments and thinking.<br>
So the Lyra8 is the force thats applied to the thoughts and the Helm synthesizer together with the other instruments in the other halt of the track represents the ordered and new outcome of this thoughts that form a musical object together.

## Project files

The project size is about 500Mb. This is why I only can share a [Google Drive Link](https://drive.google.com/open?id=1317SAEFXuIO5WC0e2JCOOFz_BnCQ_Rpd) so that you can download it and not upload it in the github repository.
