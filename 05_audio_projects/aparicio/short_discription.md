## Music Concrete: Sleep paralysis 
#### Short Discription

##### Idea

Sounds that can be associated with sleep paralysis are, on the one hand, the sound of the night. Furthermore, the ticking of a clock, because time plays an important role in the context. In dreams, the sense of time can become distorted very quickly. Especially the moment of falling asleep is very interesting, because suddenly thoughts and feelings no longer make sense, but can still be perceived relatively consciously. In addition, the sound of breathing can be significant, since the breath is still the only part of the body that can be controlled in sleep paralysis. For these reasons, these three elements are the samples that were used in the track, along with synthetically produced sounds.



##### Artistic Intention

An unpleasant, haunting sound experience is meant to symbolize the inner struggle during sleep paralysis. The ticking of a clock, which sometimes beats faster and sometimes slower, shows the warped perception of time. A spooky sound of the night provides a mystical overall sound. Thus, the first third is meant to symbolize the process of falling asleep, as the sounds that are clearly recognizable at the beginning become more and more unrecognizable. The breathing of a person brings the scenery in connection with a subject, which furthermore seems to be afraid due to the fast breathing. The comparatively very present breathing noise is supposed to make the person recognizable as the main object of the music concrete piece. The artificial sounds produced by the helmet synthesizer represent the feelings and perception phenomena distant from reality during a sleep paralysis. These sounds get louder and louder towards the end, reach a climax and then disappear completely. The person has woken up, the dream is over and a silent night returns.



##### Technical Choices

Many sounds were distributed asymmetrically to the two stereo channels with panning. Also, a "ReaVerb" effect was added to several samples. The overall sound is intended to be more immersive and unpleasant by creating a sense of spatial proximity. A feeling of "something is creeping around you" is to be created. By mixing samples/real sounds and synthetically produced sounds, a fusion of dream and reality shall be clarified. The synthetically produced sounds sound distorted and disharmonious to support the negative and threatening mood.
