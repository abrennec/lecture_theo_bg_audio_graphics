## SWARM: audio prototype 

SWARM (my orientation project) is going to be a VR audio journey through a city swarmed by a group of protesting women together with a colony of bees. Attached audio prototype is made to test storyline and find the fitting recordings. 


Guide through events order:
1. Bees have a calm, happy life inside the beehive. They are organized and living in a set rhythm of light electronic music. They like to chatter.
2. There are sounds outside that interrupt their communication, they canâ€™t hear each other anymore.
3. Police sirens with a very high pitch are too much. Bees need to swarm - leave the beehive in order to find a better place to live.
4. Bees fly into protesting crowds. There is a tension between protesting women and police cars. 
5. Bees and women manage to find an alternative way out. The start a techno procession together to find a better place. 

In SWARM audio prototype I have used documentary recordings made by myself during the black protests in Berlin and in Cracow, as well as found bee sounds.
