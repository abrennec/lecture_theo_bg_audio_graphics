Description 

Idea
- The main idea was to create a melodic sound which uses different groups of stams that create a melodic sound by themself, to create
a VR experience in which the User can activate those different groups of stams by interaction to create his own musis and to experience it in another way


Technical part
- A MIDI Keyboard was used to create the different types of tracks and stams aswell as many effects like for example Loop, Filter distortion, automated filter change over time, Compression or Echo.
