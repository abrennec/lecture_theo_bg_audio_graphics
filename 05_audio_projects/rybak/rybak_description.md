**Audio Project Description**

**Sylvia Rybak**

The concept for this project was to create a jungle soundscape that sounds like it was recorded on an alien planet. I wanted to experiment with animal-like sound effects, and make them appear both familiar and disturbing by distorting them. The soundscape instills a growing feeling of tension as a creature moves closer and closer to the listener. After a growl, the audio cuts off to white noise. 

In order to create the project I started from researching animal noises that could be interesting for my project. I then collected various samples, which I could find online and started creating a composition within reaper by arranging them in a specific order, cutting them and overlaying one on top of another. Finally I experimented with various effects within reaper such as volume adjustment, panning, pitch modulation, noise reduction, playback speed, reversing audio, white noise and using an EQ.
