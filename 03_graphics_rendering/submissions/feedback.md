 - Marco Braune: 
   - Example is well chosen, but why did you not engage with 3D?
     - What exactly are your own contributions?
     - The PGraphics objects were chosen to achieve what?
   - What would you like to achieve visually?
   - What are the benefits / drawbacks of using 3D vs 2D?
   - How would you like to continue with this? 
   - Is there a particular connection with your moodboard?

--- 
- Anna Brauwers:
 - Examples are good, but it is not fully clear to me, what exactly is your own contribution. 
   - Please make this clear in the code/comments.
   - What is the reasoning behind the choice of examples? 
 - What are the benefits / drawbacks of using 3D vs 2D?
 - What would you like to achieve visually? 
 - Is there a particular connection with your moodboard?
 - How would you like to continue with this?

- Gasparik: 
 - Very good approach to the task, very nice results, esp. 3D sketch (2D vs 3D nicely answered)
   - What do you need lights() for? 
   - What do you need perspective() for?
 - How would you like to continue with this? I.e., suggestions
   - Think about how to move through the mondrianic corridor 
   - Think about using different views, i.e. with the help of PGraphics

--- 
- Ho:
 - Nice approach to the task, how come you're into sin/cos functions? 
 - What is the benefit of 3D vs 2D in your examples though?
 - What are the benefits / drawbacks of using 3D vs 2D?
 - What would you like to achieve visually? 
 - Is there a connection with your moodboard?
 - How would you like to continue with this?

- Mircea:
 - Examples are good, but why did you not engage with 3D?
 - Checkout frameRate and frameCount to control the rendering frequency
 - What are the benefits / drawbacks of using 3D vs 2D?
 - What would you like to achieve visually? 
 - Is there a particular connection with your moodboard?
 - How would you like to continue with this?

--- 
- Rumpf:
 - Very good examples, but, please clean up the code and review the functions that you use
   - Do you need the Point, rect classes?
   - What about push- and popMatrix calls, do you need them?
 - Still, what are the benefits / drawbacks of using 3D vs 2D?
 - How would you like to continue with this? I.e., suggestions
   - Think about the use of colors
   - Think about using 3D objects (as particles?)

--- 
- Schaeuble:
  - The transforms example is good. Check it out using push- and popMatrix instead of push and pop to see what changes.
  - The mondrian examples are empty for me, please upload again

--- 
- Schreiber:
  - Nice growdrian idea, but some things are not clear to me
    - What is redraw() actually doing in your sketch, do you need it? 
    - Why do you need the for loop? 
    - What funky effect is occurring exactly _when_?
    - Why are there more boxes when you do not use push/popMatrix?
    - General questions: 
      - What is happening in the draw() function?
      - What are push/popMatrix do?
      - What are you trying to achieve?
  - How would you like to continue with this? I.e., suggestions
    - Get the basic idea right ; )
    - What about playing with different perspectives / camera views next?

---
- Volz:
  - Very good approach to the task and well implemented
  - The connection to the moodboard is quite apparent as is the benefit / drawback of 2D vs 3D
  - How would you like to continue with this? I.e., suggestions
    - Think about using blurring effects (filter(BLUR))
    - Think about storing depth information in a PGraphics for blending or masking

--- 
- Winter:
  - Nice approach to mondrian 3d, but 
    - I can hardly recognize the rendering due to the transparency settings
    - Where is the 2D counterpart?
    - Do you need the camera function?
 - What are the benefits / drawbacks of using 3D vs 2D?
 - What would you like to achieve visually? 
 - Is there a particular connection with your moodboard?
 - How would you like to continue with this?
