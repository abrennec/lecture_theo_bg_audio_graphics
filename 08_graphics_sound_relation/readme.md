# Learning Objectives -- Graphics and Sound Relations

## What?

In this session, we will work explore how to connect and relate sound and graphics parameters with p5.js. Apart from that we will talk about the final projects.

## Why?

Because we want to create an interactive or animated music album : )

## Further Material

### p5 Collection for TBAG

This is the link to the [TBAG p5 sketch collection](https://editor.p5js.org/abrennec/collections/TGI5M8556) we prepared for you.

Please check out the latest additions to this collection that show you how to work with sound in p5. In particular, 
- How to use mic input (audio in) to change a geometry's size.
- How to add a soundfile and use the amplitude (level value) to change a geometry's shading.

Please check out the p5 reference for audio and sound functionality for more examples and possibilites.

## Final Projects

Here is a link to the final projects from the previous class:
- https://indiaaparicio.github.io/tbag_online_album/

The scope and requirements for the final project is as follows:
- Submission date equals the presentation date: 16th February 2022
  - The presentation is completely informal, you will each present your final project and will be asked to briefly outline the artistic intention, technical choices and learnings 
- Time scope: approx. 4 work days 
- Final project outline
  - Sound track should be at least 2 minutes up to 3.5 minutes max; if you want to go longer that is possible but it is not a hard requirement.
  - Graphics at least one technique from the lecture, i.e., animated or interactive 2d drawing or 3d scene, shader programming is a plus but will not be a hard requirement.
  - Sound and graphics should be connected, i.e., introduce at least one audio parameter that allows you to change at least one graphics paramter (for instance, level and scale).
  - You can work with Processing or p5.js
- To be submitted in the 09_final_projects/your_name folder
  - Graphics
    - index.html
    - sketch file
    - OR the pde file 
    - plus all the assets required to execute the sketch
  - Sound
    - Sound file (mp3 and wav)
    - DAW project file plus assets
  - **Short** description of the work (1 DINA max) that contains:
    - brief oultine of your idea
    - description of the technical choices
    - description of the artistic intention
    - learnings and reflections
