## Tracklist

- **Julian Plenty - Skyscraper**
  - I like the build up and also how city sounds are woven into the arrangement.
- **Cid Rim - Polarizer**
  - I like the dramaturgy of the song. It's alternating between heavy hitting parts and very calm parts.
- **Woodkid - Run Boy Run**
  - Epic beginning with the bells which are then leading to a very perucssive track.
- **Moderat - Reminder**
  - I like the very percussive style with a nice base layer and very spatial feeling accents.
- **Sticky Fingers - Land of Pleasure**
  - The beginning gives me a feel of waitlessness and some kind of lonelyness in a vast space. I like the echoing voice.
- **Son Lux - Plans We Made**
  - I like how there is so much tension there in the beginning even though it is super calm.
- **Romare - Dreams**
  - I like how there is this kind of rhythm coming from those pulsating, wavy, vibrating sounds.
- **Hans Zimmer - Dream of Arrakis**
  - I like how drums and those stretched sound layers that echo off and also alternate from the left to the right side give you this intense feeling.

I am somehow really interested in fields, forces, turbulences, flows, attraction, tension, connections, ripples, and in colorful, glowing stuff, in dispersion, caustics, iridiscence etc.
