The songs on my tracklist are all in the area of alternative and alternative pop and pop. I chose these songs because what interests me most in producing a song is deconstructing some of my favorite songs and using the most intersing parts to create something new or to try to recrate these sounds and moments to unterstand them better. I started by picking the instrumental versions of these songs.

4. 070 Shake - Under the Moon
